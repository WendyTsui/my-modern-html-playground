playground for CSS Grid, Flex box, HTML5 layout


Started it after I stumbled upon the following blog while searching for resources to pass on to beginners: 

https://www.developer.com/lang/understanding-the-proper-way-to-lay-out-a-page-with-html5.html

Used the final source code from that blog as starting point. 

I'm also using Rachel Andrew's work to guide me:

https://gridbyexample.com/examples/page-layout/

I found Jen Simmons (Mozilla Foundation) Youtube videos of great help in my tinkering.
